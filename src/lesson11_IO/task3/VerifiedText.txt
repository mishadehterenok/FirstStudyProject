Cars are automobiles that can transport people
It is the main means of travelling for hundreds of millions of people all over the world
At first only a few people had cars but after a while more and more people bought them because they improved the way people lived
Farmers with cars were able to bring their products to places that were farther away
More and more workers drove to their jobs and people started to move to suburbs outside the town centers
Millions of people around the world work in factories where cars are produced
Millions more work at gas stations, restaurants or motels that travelers stop at
Millions of people die in car accidents every year
Automobiles pollute the air that we breathe and parking space in cities is scarce because everyone wants to use their cars to get to city centers
